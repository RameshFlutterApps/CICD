## Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment 
    CI/CD on GitHub Actions refers to Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices implemented using GitHub Actions, 
    a powerful automation tool provided by GitHub. Here's a brief summary of how it works.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
 ###### What it does
 * CI ensures that code changes are automatically tested and integrated into the main codebase frequently, usually after every push or pull request.

 ###### How it works with GitHub Actions
  * GitHub Actions allows you to define workflows in .yml files inside the .github/workflows directory. These workflows can be triggered by events such as code push, pull 
    requests, or on a schedule.
 ###### Example tasks
  * Run unit tests, lint code, build the project, and ensure that the new code doesnâ€™t break the existing codebase.

## Continuous Deployment (CD):
###### What it does: 
*   CD automates the deployment of the application to production or other environments after successful integration, making sure the latest code changes are quickly and     
    reliably deployed.
###### How it works with GitHub Actions
* Once the code passes all CI checks, GitHub Actions can trigger deployment processes to production or staging environments (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Kubernetes).
###### Example tasks
* Deploy code to a server, update a database, or trigger other post-deployment tasks like notifications or API calls.

## How GitHub Actions works
###### Workflows
* A workflow is a set of automated steps defined in a .yml file.
###### Actions
* Individual tasks in a workflow, like running tests or deploying code.
###### Runners
* GitHub-hosted or self-hosted environments that run the actions defined in workflows.

## Benefits:
### Automated Testing and Deployment: 
Reduces manual intervention, improving code quality and speed.
### Customizable: 
You can configure workflows to fit the needs of your project, whether it's testing, building, or deploying.
### Scalability: 
GitHub Actions is flexible and works for both small and large projects.

In short, CI/CD with GitHub Actions helps automate the process of testing and deploying your code, ensuring faster, more reliable updates to your application.
